Tabula statement

We're part of an academic community at Warwick.

Whether studying, teaching, or researching, we’re all taking part in an expert conversation which must meet standards of academic integrity. When we all meet these standards, we can take pride in our own academic achievements, as individuals and as an academic community.

Academic integrity means committing to honesty in academic work, giving credit where we've used others' ideas and being proud of our own achievements.

In submitting my work I confirm that:

1. I have read the guidance on academic integrity provided in the Student Handbook and understand the University regulations in relation to Academic Integrity. I am aware of the potential consequences of Academic Misconduct.

2. I declare that the work is all my own, except where I have stated otherwise.

3. No substantial part(s) of the work submitted here has also been submitted by me in other credit bearing assessments courses of study (other than in certain cases of a resubmission of a piece of work), and I acknowledge that if this has been done this may lead to an appropriate sanction.

4. Where a generative Artificial Intelligence such as ChatGPT has been used I confirm I have abided by both the University guidance and specific requirements as set out in the Student Handbook and the Assessment brief. I have clearly acknowledged the use of any generative Artificial Intelligence in my submission, my reasoning for using it and which generative AI (or AIs) I have used. Except where indicated the work is otherwise entirely my own.

5. I understand that should this piece of work raise concerns requiring investigation in relation to any of points above, it is possible that other work I have submitted for assessment will be checked, even if marks (provisional or confirmed) have been published.

6. Where a proof-reader, paid or unpaid was used, I confirm that the proofreader was made aware of and has complied with the University’s proofreading policy.

7. I consent that my work may be submitted to Turnitin or other analytical technology. I understand the use of this service (or similar), along with other methods of maintaining the integrity of the academic process, will help the University uphold academic standards and assessment fairness.

#### **Data Science Methodology**

To begin, I chose to implement John Rollin's Data Science Methodology; a 10-stage iterative process tailored for data-driven problem solving. This particular methodology aligns well with the demands of this project, given its focus on managing large data volumes, which fits our objective of accurately predicting user reviews from extensive data sets (Rollins, 2015).

In the following sections, I will highlight all relevant stages and their utilization in developing this project. This is with the exclusion of Deployment and Feedback, as they were incorporated into the methodology with  business application in mind, which is irrelevant for this project. Data Requirements/Collection have also been ignored as the dataset was provided for me.

#### **Problem Understanding/Analytic Approach**

This phase of the methodology involves accurately defining the task and identifying the appropriate analytic approach to be adopted. The assigned task was to use Yelp datasets to create a model predicting the User Reviews given by user *i* to business *j* in the test data. Given the ordinal nature of the 'stars', a regression model was the intuitive choice. This indicated the use of predictive analytics including regression models with shrinkage estimators and regression trees. Furthermore, the dataset provided is large and contains a variety of predictors, which indicates the need for a more flexible model as it would better capture a complex and potentially non-linear relationship. Inevitably, a more flexible model harms interpretability, but as I am only interested in prediction, this is not a significant concern.
